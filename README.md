# mcpaperarchsetup
A setup script that should automatically set up a papermc minecraft server on a basic arch linux installation
Includes the server itself, as well as a script to back up the server and a script that allows easy access to the server console.
It also sets up a basic ssh configuration, as well as setting up cron to allow for daily server backups.
Please note that this script is highly rudimentary and so you probably shouldn't use it for yourself.
